Added random state scrambling and two phase solving with lots of help from the source from muovod's kociemba repo <https://github.com/muodov/kociemba>

This required a change to GNU v2 license.

Also added tags. Every solve can be marked with a tag after solving to sort it from other solves.
Also added exporting. The whole session can be exported to a file.
